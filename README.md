## User Stories (Required)

* A user should be able to enter, edit, and remove menu items. The menu items have a name, a description, a category (such as appetizer, main course, side, dessert), and a price. (Unless you do the optional story, weâ€™re not concerned with user logins or security)

* A user should be able to view the menu, with items grouped by category, and see the names, descriptions, and prices.

* The menu view should allow users to select items off the menu. On submitting the form, they should be able to see the total price of their potential order. A user should be able to adjust the quantity of items in their order.

## User Stories (Optional)

* Restrict the ability to enter, edit, and remove menu items to a logged-in administrator.

* The administrator can optionally upload an image to go along with an item, if so, the image is displayed in the menu
